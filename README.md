BASIC CALCULATOR v1

vserion value are hardcodede where values are inbuild.


v2

in this version, is not hardcoded but values are takenn by user by prompting u the user with the input keyword.

v3
Since there is a logical error, in version2, where it see our values as string, it only concatenate the string. the logical error is fix in v3

V4
we are having logical error in version in v3, when wwe pass in an integer, is throwing an error because we cast our value to int(). this has just been fix in v4, using flaot, that can take both integer and floating point number.
